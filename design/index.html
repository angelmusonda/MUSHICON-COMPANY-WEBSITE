        <h2>Design Services</h2>

        <h4>1. Site Design</h4>
        <p>We create detailed site layouts for various infrastructure projects, including buildings, 
            roads, and bridges. Our planning includes the arrangement of structures, parking lots, 
            drainage systems, and landscaping to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Architectural Design</h4>
        <p>We produce custom architectural designs to meet the unique needs of our clients while 
            complying with regulatory requirements. Using advanced technology, we generate 2D 
            plans and 3D models to bring design concepts to life.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Structural Design</h4>
        <p>We design the structural components of buildings, bridges, and other structures to 
            ensure resilience against loads and environmental conditions. Our approach involves
             using sophisticated software and accurate hand calculations to determine structural
              responses, adhering to industry codes for specifying structural layouts and member 
              sizes.</p>
        
        <h4>4. Seismic Structural Design</h4>
        <p>We emphasise the importance of seismic design since seismicity in Zambia is not given 
            the serious attention it deserves. Our team of experts designs structures capable of 
            withstanding earthquakes, prioritising life safety through the application of the 
            capacity design method.</p>
        
        <h4>5. Infrastructure Rehabilitation Design</h4>
        <p>We specialise in redesigning and rehabilitating ageing infrastructure or structures
             undergoing purpose transitions. Whether transforming residential spaces into commercial
             or preserving old structures, we conduct thorough structural assessments 
             and provide retrofitting or strengthening solutions.</p>
        
        <h4>6. Geotechnical Design</h4>
        <p>We conduct in-depth analyses of soil and rock conditions to offer precise foundation 
            recommendations. Our expertise extends to designing retaining walls, slope stabilisation
             measures, and other geotechnical structures for optimal project outcomes.</p>
        
        <h4>7. Transportation Design</h4>
        <p>We plan and design comprehensive transportation systems such as roads and highways. 
        Our focus is on traffic optimisation, innovative intersection designs, and incorporating 
        robust safety features.</p>
        
        <h4>8. Water Resources Design</h4>
        <p>We expertly design water supply and distribution systems, stormwater management, and 
            flood control systems. Our solutions also include the design of wastewater treatment 
            facilities for sustainable and efficient infrastructure.</p>
        
        <h4>9. Environmental Design</h4>
        <p>We create environmentally conscious designs for protection and remediation systems. 
         Our commitment is to develop sustainable solutions that minimise the environmental impact
         of infrastructure projects.</p>
