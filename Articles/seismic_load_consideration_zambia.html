    <h2>SEISMIC LOAD CONSIDERATION IN DESIGN IN ZAMBIA</h2>
    <P> In Zambia, seismic load considerations in infrastructure design have lingered on the periphery
        of consciousness. The absence of a significant earthquake event in recent memory has perhaps 
        lulled many design engineers into a false sense of security, leading to the belief that Zambia
        is immune to it. However, a closer look reveals something that demands our immediate attention.
    </P>
    <P>The design for earthquake loads is done based on a probabilistic earthquake hazard assessment. 
        For example, In Eurocode 8 (EC8), an earthquake with a return period of 475 years is used for
            the Ultimate Limit State, while 95 years is considered for the Serviceability Limit State.
    </P>

    <p>The recently published Global Earthquake Model reveals significant levels of seismicity for the 
        above probability of occurrence. In certain areas in the northern part of the country, peak 
        ground accelerations as high as 0.2g are foreseen for the 475-year return period. This level 
        of seismicity is by no means small to be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>One of the reasons for the insufficient attention to seismic considerations is the absence of 
        a national building code or an active regulatory framework. A number of African countries such 
        as South Africa, Kenya, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda have been enforcing this for
        over three decades. It is noteworthy that South Africa, a country which has less seismicity 
        than Zambia, has been enforcing the consideration of earthquake loads.
    </p>
    <p>Earthquakes have occurred before in Zambia. Their impact may not have been felt because of the 
        nature of structures (low vulnerability) or the economic activity (low exposure) in those 
        regions that were affected. However, as our nation undergoes further development and our 
        structures reach greater heights, both seismic vulnerability and exposure rise. These two 
        combined with the clearly present seismic hazard constitute a significant seismic risk.
    </p>

    <p>As custodians of public safety, civil engineers bear the responsibility of fortifying structures
        against the unpredictable forces of nature. Neglecting the seismic risk poses a great threat 
        to the future, one that could result in catastrophic consequences. Our structures are not mere
        reflections of our present; they are legacies that will outlast us. Ensuring their resilience
        is a moral obligation and a commitment to safeguarding lives today and tomorrow.
